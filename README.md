PCA of Aurora Borealis images for dimensionality reduction

Upon completion: generative video output using LTSM deep learning

### What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?
PCA describes a dataset, often of images, using a set of common features called principal components. 
For example, in faces this could include distance between eyes, mouth width, ect.
In this dataset, features could express shapes of bursts of light in certain locations.
